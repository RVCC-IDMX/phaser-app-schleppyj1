# Bingo

## For my final project, I have chosen to create a bingo game where if the player has a number that matches what is called,
## they are able to click on the cell with the matching number and a sound effect is played. If the player gets a bingo, another
## sound effect will play and the game will ask the player if they want to play again.

# Instructions:

## Click on the next number button to generate a random number. If the number called matches the number on your board, click on
## that cell to mark the number on your board. When you get five numbers in a row (vertical, horizontal or diagonal),
## you have won the game! A button will then generate asking you to play again.
